A simple, one pager app coded with JS/CSS/HMTL, that takes user input data (bill amount, desired tip percentage, number of people dining together), and outputs the total amount that is to be paid per person. Never get tricked again by your friends or work colleagues!

Inspiration for this project comes from Frontend Mentor:

1. Enter bill amount.
2. Set the tip % - use predefined values, od add your custom one.
3. Enter amount of people dinning together.
4. Hit "calculate" button.
5. Enjoy the results or hit "reset" and start again. 

## Current status:

Work in progress

## To do's:

1. For now tip calculation works only for first button - add that to remaining ones.
