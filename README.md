# Tip-calculator

A simple, one pager app created with JS/CSS/HMTL, that takes user input data (bill amount, desired tip percentage, number of people dining together), and outputs the total amount that is to be paid per person. Never get tricked again by your friends or work colleagues!

Inspiration for this project comes from Frontend Mentor:
